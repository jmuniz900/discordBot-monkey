# Llama's very own Monkey Bot
Welcome to one of my side projects, a discord bot in the making. So far, 
not a lot is done as it is the first version and I'm start to learn about Discord's API. 
It'll be run at [this discord server](https://discord.gg/qxS2FSTr) once it's ready, but 
for now, it's just learning from the ground up.

## Things it can do so far...
Currently, the only message/commands it can do is:
- typing "monke version"
  - this will give an embed of version information.
- typing "gorilla spin"
  - will return a string of the bot saying "OOO OOO AAA AAA" 
- typing "monke fact"
  - returns embed of a random monkey fact (work in progress)

## To Do List
What I'm hoping to be able to do is:
- [ ] Get monkey fact working using a database of monkey facts
- [ ] A troll command that when connected to the voice chat, will talk over others with monkey noises
- [ ] Have it have a command called $quieres that gives the image of the quieres meme but with a banana

### Updates
None so far. This will be updated as more features are added.
